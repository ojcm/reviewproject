# TO DO

## BOOTSTRAPIFY
+ Remaining views (companies/index, companies/show, feedback/new)
+ Test forms.

## Must do:
+ Auto calculate company accomodation rating scores.
+ Bootstrapify currently hidden pages.

## Nice to have:
+ Display review scores as stars rather than numbers.
+ Search on other fields.
+ Tidy UI
+ When no comments, show comment loading (or something like that) from semantic UI with the link to make a new comment. 
+ Fix layout on index page when company name is long.

## Consider:
+ Switch to SQL database?

## Post MVP
+ User log in features.
