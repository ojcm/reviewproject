# TO DO

## Must do:
+ Auto calculate company rating scores
+ Display rating scores for company.
+ Calculate overall rating for review + display.

## Nice to have:
+ Move "Add review" button to top of review list
+ Display review scores as stars rather than numbers.
+ Add 'piecework' (rather than hourly/daily pay) to review form.
+ Search on other fields.
+ Tidy UI
+ When no comments, show comment loading (or something like that) from semantic UI with the link to make a new comment. 
+ Fix layout on index page when company name is long.

## Consider:
+ Switch to SQL database?

## Post MVP
+ User log in features.
