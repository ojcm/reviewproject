# TO DO

## Must do:
+ Auto calculate company rating scores
+ Display rating scores.
+ Display more review details on company page.

## Nice to have:
+ Add 'piecework' (rather than hourly/daily pay) to review form.
+ Search on other fields.
+ Tidy UI
+ When no comments, show comment loading (or something like that) from semantic UI with the link to make a new comment. 
+ Fix layout on index page when company name is long.

## Consider:
+ Switch to SQL database?
